When using the ec2 modules, the following need to be provided:

  - region     = region
  - access key = aws_access_key
  - secret key = aws_secret_key

They can be provided as variables in the playbook file, in environment variables, or, in
some cases, in files in the ~/.aws directory.  If the information is in the ~/.aws directory,
boto or boto3 is used to retrive the information.  If boto is used, the access key and secret key
are retrieved and passed to the module.  If boto3 is used, the access key, secret key, and region
are retrieved and passed to the module.  Some modules use boto and some boto3; given that, it may
be easier to specify the region when using ec2 modules for consistency.

To use the boto approach, create the ~/.aws directory with 2 files:

config:
[default]
region=us-east-1

credentials:
[default]
aws_access_key_id = ***
aws_secret_access_key = ***

With this set, the steps to create an environment include:
----------------------------------------------------------

1.  Create a VPC

Use ec2_vpc_net for this (ec2_vpc is deprecated)

When the VPC is created, the default security group is also created for the VPC and it cannot be removed.

2.  Create a subnet and associate it to the VPC

Use ec2_vpc_subnet for this

3.  Create a security group and associate it to the VPC

Use ec2_group for this

To remove the environment:
--------------------------

1.  Gather the facts about the VPC

2.  Use the VPC fact information to gather the facts about the security group

3.  Remove the security group

4.  Use the VPC fact information to gather the facts about the subnet

5.  Remove the subnet

6.  Remove the VPC
